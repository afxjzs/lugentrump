[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lying_press):
"Lying press (German: LÃ¼genpresse, lit. 'press of lies') is a pejorative political term used largely by German political movements for the printed press and the mass media at large, when it is believed not to have the quest for truth at the heart of its coverage."
"The Nazis adopted the term for their propaganda against the Jewish, communist, and later the foreign press."
